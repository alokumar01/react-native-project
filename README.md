# React Native Project (Learning)

This is a React Native mobile application built using **Expo** and **JavaScript **.  
The structure follows modern practices using **Expo Router** for file-based navigation.

This project is a part of my hands-on learning journey through tutorials on YouTube.  
It's focused on understanding the fundamentals of building cross-platform apps using **React Native + Expo**.
